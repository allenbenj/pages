# An Edifice of Lies - Case Presentation

A comprehensive web-based presentation documenting the case of State v. Benjamin Allen, revealing systematic contradictions, investigative failures, and prosecutorial misconduct.

## Overview

This presentation provides a detailed analysis of a criminal case built on fabricated evidence, contradictory testimony, and physical impossibilities. The evidence demonstrates how a narrative was constructed and maintained despite being contradicted by video evidence, physical geography, and basic physics.

## Features

- **Orbital Carousel Navigation**: Innovative 3D rotating navigation system with hover-activated rotation
- **Interactive Timeline**: Visual timeline with video evidence and contradiction markers
- **Evidence Analysis**: Comprehensive breakdown of contradictions between testimony and physical evidence
- **Video Integration**: Embedded surveillance footage showing real-time contradictions
- **Mindmap Visualizations**: Interactive OPML-based mindmaps of misconduct patterns
- **Responsive Design**: Works across desktop and mobile devices
