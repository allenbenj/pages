        Deal claimed that she sustained bruising to her arms as a result of being pinned  during her initial interview with police.

        The SANE examination documents only a knee contusion and a foot abrasion, with no findings consistent with arm restraint or pinning.

        Detective Freeman’s testimony asserting that he observed arm bruising directly contradicts the photographic and medical evidence, indicating fabrication or coordination with an unsupported narrative.

        The allegation of arm bruising appears to have been introduced solely to bolster the plausibility of the accusation and has no medical or evidentiary basis in fact.

        The account is biomechanically inconsistent with the claimed timeline, the absence of injuries, and basic human physical capability. As alleged, the assailant simultaneously restrained the complainant’s outstretched arms above her head while removing her clothing. That sequence is physically untenable. Maintaining control of both raised arms requires continuous bilateral force and body positioning that precludes the simultaneous removal of the complainant’s pants. For the allegation to be true, the assailant would have had to pull the complainant’s clothing downward through his own body while still restraining both arms—an action that is not physically feasible. This fundamental physical impossibility was not addressed or reconciled at the time the accusation was made.
    </li>
<br>
    <li>
        The alleged push mechanics are likewise implausible. The claim asserts that the assailant pushed the complainant in the upper back toward the bed, resulting in the complainant landing on her back. That sequence is inconsistent with basic principles of human biomechanics and physics. A forward-directed force applied to the upper back would propel the body forward and downward, not invert it onto a supine position absent an intervening mechanism or secondary force. The described outcome cannot occur from the alleged action as stated. These assertions are therefore not merely questionable or unsupported—they are physically impossible.
    </li>
<br>
    <li>
        No prior touching or sexual remarks by Allen are alleged. The complainant claims he spoke to her, then later asserts he never said a word.
    </li>
<br>
    <li>
        Deal claims she pulled her pants down to urinate, then pulled them up, after which Allen allegedly pushed her and again removed tight leggings—despite those leggings necessarily being compressed by her body weight while on the bed.
    </li>

   <br>
        This is a manufactured scenario constructed to make the narrative appear more believable, despite internal contradictions and biomechanical impossibilities.
